# Abstract

Write a summary of your project (around 300 words) here. This section should provide a concise overview of your research question, data, methods, and key findings.

This project investigates the factors that influence pet adoption at the Long Beach Animal Shelter, using a dataset provided via the {animalshelter} R package and TidyTuesday repository. With over 29,000 animal records, we aim to identify the variables that significantly impact the likelihood of an animal being adopted.

Our research focuses on predicting adoption (yes/no) using a logistic regression model. Key predictors include species animal_type, intake condition, sex, intake type, primary color, and season of outcome. After cleaning and transforming the dataset—including recoding the outcome into a binary variable and engineering a season variable—we explore adoption rates across each predictor and fit a Bernoulli logistic model to estimate the probability of adoption.

Preliminary analysis reveals variation in adoption likelihood across animal species and intake types, as well as some seasonal trends. This analysis offers actionable insights for shelters looking to optimize adoption efforts and prioritize animals who may need more assistance finding homes. CHANGE THIS (JUST FILLER)

# Introduction

In this section, introduce the problem and question(s) of interest that you aim to address in your analysis. Provide relevant background information and explain the motivation and significance of your research question. Cite manuscripts or websites you use. Here an example of how to cite a paper, @wickham2019. See  @quarto_cit for how to manage citations in Quarto.

Animal shelters play a vital role in animal welfare, often facing resource constraints while handling high intake volumes. One pressing issue is determining which animals are most likely to be adopted and how different factors affect this likelihood. Better understanding of adoption patterns can inform targeted interventions to improve outcomes.

Our main research questions are:

Are certain types of pets more likely to be adopted than others?

How do factors like intake condition, sex, intake type, and season influence adoption likelihood?

Using data from the Long Beach Animal Shelter, we aim to model adoption probabilities and highlight actionable trends. This work builds on the goal of improving animal outcomes through evidence-based strategies.


# Data and Methods

Describe the data you used in your analysis, including the source, characteristics, and any pre-processing or cleaning steps you performed. 

```{r}
## Do not include much code in the report
## make separate scripts if you have a lot of cleaning to do for the data
## and for model exploration

## Data Description and Preprocessing

The dataset for this project comes from the Long Beach Animal Shelter, obtained through the `animalshelter` R package and the TidyTuesday project (March 4, 2025). It contains over 29,000 records on individual animals, including species, intake condition, intake type, sex, primary color, outcome type, and outcome date.

### Data Cleaning Steps

To prepare the data for analysis, we performed the following steps:

- **Outcome Recoding**:  
  We created a binary variable `adopted`, where:
  - `1` = the animal was adopted (outcome_type == "Adoption")
  - `0` = all other outcome types (e.g., transfer, return, euthanasia)

- **Factor Conversion**:  
  Categorical variables were converted into factors for modeling:
  - `animal_type`, `intake_condition`, `sex`, `intake_type`, and `primary_color`

- **Season Variable Engineering**:  
  We created a `season` variable from `outcome_date`:
  - Winter: December–February  
  - Spring: March–May  
  - Summer: June–August  
  - Fall: September–November

- **Color Grouping**:  
  The original `primary_color` variable contained many highly specific labels (e.g., “blue merle”, “calico dilute”). We grouped these into broader, interpretable categories stored in a new `color` variable:
  - *Patterns*: e.g., calico, tabby, merle
  - *Browns*: e.g., brown, chocolate, sable
  - *Grays and blues*: e.g., blue, gray, silver
  - *Orange and red*: e.g., red, orange, ruddy
  - *Black or dark*: e.g., black, tortie
  - *White based*: e.g., white, lilac point
  - *Cream and yellows*: e.g., cream, gold, wheat
  - *Greens*: retained as a rare but existing entry

- **Missing Data**:  
  To ensure model integrity, we excluded rows with missing values in any of the analysis variables using `na.omit()`.

The resulting cleaned dataset, named `longbeach_clean`, includes the following variables:
- `adopted`
- `animal_type`
- `intake_condition`
- `sex`
- `intake_type`
- `outcome_date`
- `primary_color`
- `season`
- `color`

This version was saved as an `.rds` file for reproducibility and used throughout the rest of the analysis.





This is a good place where to include results of your exploratory data analysis. See @fig-eda as an example. 
Check the .qmd file for an example of how to include plots, control their size and include references in the text. 


In our exploratory data analysis, we found that overall, there was a higher proportion of animals that were not adopted compared to adopted. Not adopted means everything other than adopted. So the animal could have passed away or been sent back, just not adopted. We also found that most of the plots created vs adoption rates have some categories that stick out more than the rest. The only plots that did not were color and seasons which were two categories that we mutated ourselves. All of the plots created during our exploratory data analysis can be seen above with comments to explain the graphs and how they helped us come to our overall conclusion.



#You should also explain the methods you employed. I expect you to define the statistical model you chose for #your data in mathematical form, as we did throughout the course. 

#Crab example: 

We define as outcome the adoption for each animal and denote the observed values as $y_i$ with $i = 1, \ldots, n$ with $n = 29600$. Let $y_i = 1$ indicate an animal being adopted and $0$ otherwise. 

We assume that each $y_i$ is a realization of a random variables $Y_i \sim \mbox{Bernoulli}(p_i)$ independently, and model the probability of an animal being adopted using the following logistic regression:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \mbox{logit}(p_i) = & \beta_0 + \\

Overall, the best model we found that contained the lowest AIC value included four key predictions. These were animal type, intake condition, sex, and intake type. We found that sex was the strongest individual predictor for adoption likelihood. Sterilized animals were significantly more likely to be adopted than inteact males which was the baseline. The intake condition with the baseline as normally behaved reported that animals in poor health and behavioral issues were less likely to be adopted. Animals that were categorized as feral, fractious, or severe illness or injury had adoption odds 70-93% lower than healthy animals. Animal type is also a significant predictior. Our results showed that guinea pigs are 6 times more likely to be adopted than dogs and livestock was 13 times more likely to be adopted than dogs which was our baseline animal. Dogs however were the animal with the second highest population in the shelter. Lastly, types of stray, owner surrender, foster, and confinscate were not significantly significant predictors of adoption. TNR animals which stands for trapped, sterilized, and returned to their original location are not necessarily meant for adoption, however our model did show it was statistically significant. In the future, this is something to look more into specifically with TNR animals. Also in the future, it could be interesting to compare models when we group adoption vs. everything else as well as keeping the "everything else" categories separate. Overall, suggestions to the Long Beach Animal shelter would be to keep including variety in their animal selection because as we have seen in our results, it's not just perfect dogs and cats that get adopted. Every animal has a home.

If you want to include your R code as an appendix, you can create a new code chunk and set `#| echo: true` to show the code and `#| eval: false` to avoid that to be run. You can also provide scripts separately as supplementary material.

```{r}

## Good practice to include libraries and functions you will need in a chunk
## at the beginning of your file
library(jtools)
library(patchwork)
library(tidyverse)
## functions
logit <- function(x) log(x/(1 - x))
invlogit <- function(x) exp(x)/(1 + exp(x))

## This sets the gpplot theme to white for all plots
## the option `base_size` sets the base font size for all plots
theme_set(

# Abstract

Write a summary of your project (around 300 words) here. This section should provide a concise overview of your research question, data, methods, and key findings.

This project investigates the factors that influence pet adoption at the Long Beach Animal Shelter, using a dataset provided via the {animalshelter} R package and TidyTuesday repository. With over 29,000 animal records, we aim to identify the variables that significantly impact the likelihood of an animal being adopted.

Our research focuses on predicting adoption (yes/no) using a logistic regression model. Key predictors include species animal_type, intake condition, sex, intake type, primary color, and season of outcome. After cleaning and transforming the dataset—including recoding the outcome into a binary variable and engineering a season variable—we explore adoption rates across each predictor and fit a Bernoulli logistic model to estimate the probability of adoption.

Preliminary analysis reveals variation in adoption likelihood across animal species and intake types, as well as some seasonal trends. This analysis offers actionable insights for shelters looking to optimize adoption efforts and prioritize animals who may need more assistance finding homes. CHANGE THIS (JUST FILLER)

# Introduction

In this section, introduce the problem and question(s) of interest that you aim to address in your analysis. Provide relevant background information and explain the motivation and significance of your research question. Cite manuscripts or websites you use.

Animal shelters play a vital role in animal welfare, often facing resource constraints while handling high intake volumes. One pressing issue is determining which animals are most likely to be adopted and how different factors affect this likelihood. Better understanding of adoption patterns can inform targeted interventions to improve outcomes.

Our main research questions are:

Are certain types of pets more likely to be adopted than others?

How do factors like intake condition, sex, intake type, and season influence adoption likelihood?

Using data from the Long Beach Animal Shelter, we aim to model adoption probabilities and highlight actionable trends. This work builds on the goal of improving animal outcomes through evidence-based strategies.


# Data and Methods

Describe the data you used in your analysis, including the source, characteristics, and any pre-processing or cleaning steps you performed. 

```{r}
## Do not include much code in the report
## make separate scripts if you have a lot of cleaning to do for the data
## and for model exploration 

## reading data
crabs <- read_csv(file= "data/crabs_cleaned.csv")

## convert to factor the necesary variables
crabs <- crabs |>
  mutate(
    color = factor(color, 
                   labels = c("light medium", "medium", "dark medium", "dark")),
    spine = factor(spine, 
                   labels = c("both good", "one worn or broken", "both worn or broken")), 
)

```

```{r}
# Load Data
longbeach_partial <- readRDS("data/longbeach_partial.rds")

# Create a binary variable: 1 if adopted, 0 otherwise
longbeach <- longbeach_partial %>%
  mutate(adopted = ifelse(tolower(trimws(outcome_type)) == "adoption", 1, 0))

# Make animal type a factor
longbeach <- longbeach %>%
  mutate(
    animal_type = as.factor(animal_type),
    intake_condition = as.factor(intake_condition),
    sex = as.factor(sex),
    intake_type = as.factor(intake_type)
  )

# Make seasons
longbeach <- longbeach %>%
  mutate(season = case_when(
    format(outcome_date, "%m") %in% c("12", "01", "02") ~ "Winter",
    format(outcome_date, "%m") %in% c("03", "04", "05") ~ "Spring",
    format(outcome_date, "%m") %in% c("06", "07", "08") ~ "Summer",
    format(outcome_date, "%m") %in% c("09", "10", "11") ~ "Fall",
    TRUE ~ NA_character_
  ))
longbeach_clean <- na.omit(longbeach %>%
                             select(adopted, animal_type, intake_condition, sex, intake_type, outcome_date, primary_color, season))
```




```{r}
## Produce figures

crabs_prop <- crabs |>
  group_by(color) |>
  summarize(
    prop_has_satellite = mean(has_satellite),
    logit_prob_has_satellite = logit(prop_has_satellite),
    total_crabs = length(has_satellite)

plot2 <- ggplot(crabs) +
     geom_boxplot(aes(x = width, y = has_satellite, group = has_satellite)) +
     labs(title = "Distribution of width across groups")
 
# Arrange multiple plots using patchwork

## Data Description and Preprocessing

The dataset for this project comes from the Long Beach Animal Shelter, obtained through the `animalshelter` R package and the TidyTuesday project (March 4, 2025). It contains over 29,000 records on individual animals, including species, intake condition, intake type, sex, primary color, outcome type, and outcome date.

### Data Cleaning Steps

To prepare the data for analysis, we performed the following steps:

- **Outcome Recoding**:  
  We created a binary variable `adopted`, where:
  - `1` = the animal was adopted (outcome_type == "Adoption")
  - `0` = all other outcome types (e.g., transfer, return, euthanasia)

- **Factor Conversion**:  
  Categorical variables were converted into factors for modeling:
  - `animal_type`, `intake_condition`, `sex`, `intake_type`, and `primary_color`

- **Season Variable Engineering**:  
  We created a `season` variable from `outcome_date`:
  - Winter: December–February  
  - Spring: March–May  
  - Summer: June–August  
  - Fall: September–November

- **Color Grouping**:  
  The original `primary_color` variable contained many highly specific labels (e.g., “blue merle”, “calico dilute”). We grouped these into broader, interpretable categories stored in a new `color` variable:
  - *Patterns*: e.g., calico, tabby, merle
  - *Browns*: e.g., brown, chocolate, sable
  - *Grays and blues*: e.g., blue, gray, silver
  - *Orange and red*: e.g., red, orange, ruddy
  - *Black or dark*: e.g., black, tortie
  - *White based*: e.g., white, lilac point
  - *Cream and yellows*: e.g., cream, gold, wheat
  - *Greens*: retained as a rare but existing entry

- **Missing Data**:  
  To ensure model integrity, we excluded rows with missing values in any of the analysis variables using `na.omit()`.

The resulting cleaned dataset, named `longbeach_clean`, includes the following variables:
- `adopted`
- `animal_type`
- `intake_condition`
- `sex`
- `intake_type`
- `outcome_date`
- `primary_color`
- `season`
- `color`

This version was saved as an `.rds` file for reproducibility and used throughout the rest of the analysis.





This is a good place where to include results of your exploratory data analysis. See @fig-eda as an example. 
Check the .qmd file for an example of how to include plots, control their size and include references in the text. 


You should also explain the methods you employed. I expect you to define the statistical model you chose for your data in mathematical form, as we did throughout the course. 

Crab example: we define as outcome the presence/absence of a satellite for each crab and denote the observed values as $y_i$ with $i = 1, \ldots, n$ with $n = 173$. Let $y_i = 1$ indicate presence of a satellite and $0$ otherwise. 

We assume that each $y_i$ is a realization of a random variables $Y_i \sim \mbox{Bernoulli}(p_i)$ independently, and model the probability of having a satellite for each crab using the following logistic regression:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \mbox{logit}(p_i) = & \beta_0 + \\ 
                    & \beta_1 \times \text{I(color == medium)}_i  \\
                   & \beta_2 \times \text{I(color == dark medium)}_i \\
                   & \beta_3 \times \text{I(color == dark)}_i \\
                   & \beta_4  \times \text{I(width)}_i
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-crab-model}

where $\mbox{I}()$ in @eq-crab-model indicates a dummy variable, taking value 1 when the condition is true and zero otherwise. 

# Results
Present your results in this section, including figures, tables, and any other relevant outputs from your analysis. 

```{r}
#| label: model-summary
#| tbl-cap: "Logistic regression summary"

m_color_width <- glm(has_satellite ~ color + width, family = 'binomial', data = crabs)
summ(m_color_width, model.info = FALSE, model.fit = FALSE)
```

You can also include figure that you previously saved.

See \url{https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures.html} for more options. 

To display the model summary in a nice format you can use the `summ()` function from the `jtools` package.
 
Other libraries: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{xtable}: good if you are familiar with latex (see \href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xtable/vignettes/xtableGallery.pdf}{xtable documentation} for examples)
\item \texttt{gtable}, implements a ``grammar of table'' idea (see \url{https://gt.rstudio.com} for documentation)
\end{itemize}

In this section, discuss and interpret your results. Explain the implications and significance of your findings, and relate them to your research question and existing literature or theories.
